  <h1>Welcome to the Game!</h1>
  <h2>In the game, you need to complete 3 challenges, as outlined below.</h2>
  </br>
  <h3>Same Game</h3>
  <p>In this game, you must remove blocks from the grid. Click blocks to remove them.
     Blocks that are the same color either up, down, left, or right of the block you
     clicked will be removed. Single blocks cannot be removed. Removing blocks gives
     you points. The more more you remove at once, the higher of a score you get. The
     game is completed when there are no meves left. If there are no blocks left or you
     get a score of 1000 or higher, you may proceed to the next challenge.</p>

  </br>

  <h3>Snake</h3>
  <p>This is just like the classic game of snake. Move the snake with the arrow keys to
     collect the green squares. Upon collecting a square, the snake increases its length
     by 1. Press any key to start. The snake starts the game moving up. Don't run into
     the walls or yourself. If you do, you die. If you die after collecting 20 squares,
     you may move onto the next level.</br>P.S. If you just see a blank canvas, try hitting
     the reset buttons a few times.</p>

  </br>

  <h3>Towers of Hanoi</h3>
  <p>In this game, you must move blocks from the first column to the last column. Blocks
     may only be moved to a different column if they came from the top of the stack and
     all blocks beneath it are larger. You have a limited number of moves. CAUTION: If
     you make an invalid move, you still lose one move. Upon moving all blocks from the
     first column to the last column, you have completed the Game. Congratulations.</p>
