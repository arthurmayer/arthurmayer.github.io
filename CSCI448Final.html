				<h2 class="descripTitle">The Fundamentals</h2>
				<p class="description">We created this app to serve as a companion for the CSCI448 class at Colorado School of Mines.
                This app makes things like checking assignment due dates, the grading rubric, or the TA's email more accessible
                on-the-go. Portability and accessibility were our main focuses for the student, and being able to easily update
                information on the app was our focus for the professor.</p>

				<h2 class="descripTitle">The Features</h2>
				<p class="description">Our app takes the course webpage for CSCI448 and makes it easier to access via a mobile device.
                We took the home, assignment list, schedule, resources, and syllabus pages and condensed them into a simple format
                that a student can navigate to find exactly what they are looking for easily and quickly. All information you see on
                the app is held on a FireBase database, which can be easily updated by the professor in the case of due date changes,
                office hour adjustments, etc. Once this is updated, loading the app should show the new information. We also included
                links to Piazza and Canvas that will either open their respective apps if available or open a webview of their site.
                Our app is easy to navigate and use for the student and easy to update for the professor.
                to use for the student and easy to update for the professor.</p>

                <h2 class="descripTitle">The Future</h2>
                <p class="description">This particular implementation, only capturing the CSCI448 class, is complete. Minor
                alterations could be made with a focus on accessibility, but the greatest future possibility for this app is to
                allow it to encompass <i>any</i> class at <i>any</i> school. Because of the simple format, there are a huge number
                of courses just at CSM that this app could be repurposed to accomodate. As such, creating a program that takes the
                skeletal structure of this app and the input of the professor could allow any professor to easily create an app for
                their class. In the mobile age we live in, this would empower professors to provide more resources to their students
                and assist their students in keeping up with their classes.</p>
