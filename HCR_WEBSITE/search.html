Our research lies at the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence, and augmented and mixed reality, with specific research topics focusing on robot adaptation and learning, multisensory perception, and human-robot/swarm teaming in dynamic, unstructured, open, and potentially adversarial environments. Our work iscomputational, in that we develop innovative algorithms, approaches, and software architectures that have provable properties to enable lifelong collaborative autonomy. We focus on both theoretical and applied research that leads to fundamentally new concepts and systems that can be demonstrated on real robots in lifelong collaborative autonomy applications, including robot-assisted inspection and repair, environment exploration and monitoring, autonomous driving, search and rescue, Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT), among others where robots are a critical component or a promising solution. We are looking for highly self-motivated students who are interested in robotics, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality.

The robotics field continues to evolve rapidly. Now, robots are starting to go underground to explore mines, caves and tunnels that can be pretty dangerous to humans.\" Working together withDr. Andrew Petruska, we are developing a team of autonomous, collaborative unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for underground reconnaissance. This research was reported byCGTN AMERICA in July 2018. Robots might help prevent toxic mine spills \"Crumbling mine tunnels awash with polluted waters perforate the Colorado mountains, and scientists may one day send robots creeping through the pitch-black passages to study the mysterious currents that sometimes burst to the surface with devastating effects.\" Collaborate with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), our research on abandoned mine reconnaissance was reported initially by theAssociated Press in January 2018, and then reposted bythe Denver Post,Fox News, Science News, and many others. Mines develops app to track gymnasts\' performance data Needs a caption? Needs a citation? Needs to be a different image? Collaborating with the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), our team (PhD student Brian Reily,Dr. William Hoff, and Dr. Hao Zhang) developed a software that uses a color-depth camera to automate the analysis and scoring of gymnasts movements.

Current Projects Robotic Solutions for Underground Exploration The global community is increasingly exploring underground environments for sustainable and resilient solutions to societal problems. Communities are moving infrastructure such as roads, data centers, and water treatment facilities below ground. Exploration, inspection and rescue operations in underground environments are both unsafe and challenging, requiring the use of a number of advanced technologies like robotics and robotic swarms. Many challenges must be addressed to design effective robotics solutions for the underground. For example, robots must be able to recognize victims and critical objects, localize themselves in similar underground environments, navigate autonomously over various terrain, and collaborate under communication constraints. Sponsors: NSF Robot-Assisted Reconnaissance, Inspection, and Repair Reconnaissance, inspection, and repair in dangerous environment has many real-world applications. For example, it is essential to detect treats in power plant boilers or pipeline networks, and track their growth rate over time across multiple inspections, as a boiler or pipeline accident can cost millions of dollars for healthcare bills, infrastructure replacement, environmental response, and clean-up operations. Many computational challenges are present in such applications, including how robots can recognize objects of interest (e.g., erosions in boilers or pipes), how to localize them in multiple runs potentially across a long time span, and how to track and predict their changes over time (e.g., growth rate of erosions). Sponsors: DOE and DOT Robot Modelling of People and Teamwork We envision that robots and humans team up and work together side-by-side with an interaction style that is not based on direct controls and commands from humans to robots, but rather on the idea that robots can implicitly infer human intents and activities through passive observation. This would allow a person to collaborate with robots in a natural manner, as he/she would when teaming with human teammates, thus bypassing the difficulty of cognitive overload that occurs when humans are required to explicitly supervise robot teammates. This direction of research focuses on estimating human states (e.g., activities, emotions, intents, and goals) and modeling teamwork from robots' multisensory observations. Sponsors: NSF, ARO, USAFA, and CERC Distributed Collaboration Localization and Tracking Robust and efficient detection and tracking of objects in complex environments is critical to ensure safe and effective operations of autonomous agents in real-world human-centered environments. Our research is focused on developing approaches of collaborative perception from multiple agents to detect, localize, and track multiple objects with deformable shapes and significant appearance changes during long periods of time. This research supports our applications including human-robot teaming, autonomous driving, and augmented reality (AR).
